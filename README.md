# rustw

A web frontend for the Rust compiler.

Be warned: very work in progress!

Motivation:

* Better errors - we should have interactive experiences for exploring and
  visualising errors involving the borrow checker, macros, etc. Also, easy
  access to error explanations and docs.
* Explore code - provide a platform for searching and understanding source code.
* Convenience - one click to rebuild, easy to edit and explore code, GUI for
  multirust (in some ways this is a minimal IDE experience, focussed on
  building, rather than editing).
